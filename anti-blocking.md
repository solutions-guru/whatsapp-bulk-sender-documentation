## WhatsApp Anti-Blocking System

To ensure the success of your WhatsApp campaigns and minimize the risk of account blocking, it is essential to follow best practices. This guide provides actionable tips and strategies to help you maintain the health of your WhatsApp Business account while running bulk messaging campaigns effectively.

1. **Use WhatsApp Business Number**: Always use a WhatsApp Business number to run campaigns. Avoid using personal WhatsApp accounts for bulk messages.
2. **Update WhatsApp**: Ensure your mobile WhatsApp is updated in the Play Store before logging into the panel. Confirm that your Business WhatsApp is updated before scanning the code to log in.
3. **Use Old Numbers**: Prefer old Business WhatsApp numbers as they have better sending and receiving capabilities. Avoid using new numbers as they are more likely to get blocked.
4. **Warm-Up Process for New Numbers**:
   - Join 15-20 WhatsApp groups.
   - Log in to the WhatsApp account through the panel.
   - Enable Auto Responder and Chatbot for 2 weeks.
   - Avoid sending bulk messages during this period.
5. **Use Name Variables**: If you have names and numbers in your data, use the name variables feature to personalize bulk messages. This reduces the chances of your number being blocked.
6. **Time Intervals**: Maintain a 20-60 second interval between two messages while sending bulk messages.
7. **Avoid Links in Bulk Messages**: Do not include links in bulk messages.
8. **Targeted Audience**: Send bulk messages only to a targeted audience to avoid spam reports. Start messages to new customers with "Hi" or "Hello" before sending promotional content.
